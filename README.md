Compile markdown to html for reveal.js  

The name comes from the markdown file extension: md or medical doctor, mixed with the eveal or evil part of "reveal".

This should have 3 parts:
+ The parser of the markdown:
+ The converter
+ the generator 

This is currently written in python because I need this done relatively quickly, and I don't have the time to learn haskell
or learn racket file I/O. But ultimately I would prefer to do this in a functional language (maybe racket or haskell)
